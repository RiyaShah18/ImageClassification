This project entails the utilization of machine learning techniques for the Image Classification of 5 sports personalities:
1) Maria Sharapova
2) Serena Williams
3) Virat Kohli
4) Roger Federer
5) Lionel Messi

Technologies used in this project,
1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE

Performances of machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine are systematically evaluated and compared. Subsequently, the model demonstrating the most favorable performance characteristics is selected.
